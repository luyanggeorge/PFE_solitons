## Version Description

- The present version can be used to simulate SP1 and SP2 with SE or SV
  - SP1 is implemented in 2D
  - SP2 in 3D. $U_0$ and $c_0$ are independent of time and they are only calculated once before entering the time loop
- The initialization of SP3 remains to be added

## Results and Discussions

- SP2
  - The solutions seem to be periodic in the $x$-direction
  - However, there are in total four ripples that form and develop on the two boundaries $x=x_1$ and $x=x_2$, and they are symmetrical to each other.
- ➡️ Evaluate $U_0$ and $c_0$ at each time step
